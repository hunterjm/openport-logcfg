# Subaru OpenPort LogCfg Generator

This is the public repository of the tool located at <http://subaru.hunterjm.com>.  The service is hosted on [OpenShift], and thus has a fairly strange structure with potential deployment hooks located in the .openshift directory.  If you were to deploy this on your own, and not on an [OpenShift] app, you would only need the `public` and `misc` directories.
